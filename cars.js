        'Anytime there is a redesigned Ford F-150, it is kind of a big deal. After all, the F-150 has dominated vehicle sales in the United States for decades. So here we are with the redesigned 2021 F-150. There is no revolutionary shift in construction this year, unlike in 2015 when Ford debuted aluminum body panels on the F-150. Instead, Ford has focused on enhancing the trucks capability in other ways. Examples include a new hybrid powertrain, a robust onboard generator, and an updated interior with a new infotainment system.',
